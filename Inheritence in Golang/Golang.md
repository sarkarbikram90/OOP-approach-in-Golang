// There is no class hierarchy in Golang
// In Golang inheritence can be simulated through composition
// The main difference between inheritence and composition is
// The Inheritence provides is a/an relation between classes
// the composition provides has a/an relation between structs

// A building is a house
// A house has a bathroom

// composition is based on the principle of embedding small objects into larger objects
// bathroom object is embedded into house object
// This means house object has a bathroom object
